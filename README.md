## Overall
JustWhen is an application i made during the new year breaks and it is my first ios application. I wanted to make an application which will help me keeps track on my class schedule and wanted to learn something new. The app is simple and easy for beginner like me. I am working on adding score calculator to the app and calculate an estimated GPA. Also the feature that will let user edit and arrange class within the app.
